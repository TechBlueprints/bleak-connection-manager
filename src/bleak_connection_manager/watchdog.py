"""Connection watchdog for monitoring BLE notification activity.

Detects "zombie" connections where BlueZ still reports Connected=True
but no notifications are being received — the radio link is effectively
dead without a disconnect callback ever firing.

The caller must specify the expected timeout because only the caller
knows the device's notification cadence.  There is no sensible default
— a battery BMS sends every 1-5 s while a temperature sensor may send
every 60 s.  Making the timeout explicit forces the caller to think
about what "dead" means for their specific device.

Usage::

    watchdog = ConnectionWatchdog(
        timeout=30.0,
        on_timeout=my_reconnect_callback,
    )
    watchdog.start()

    # In your notification callback:
    watchdog.notify_activity()

    # When done:
    watchdog.stop()

When *client* and *device* are provided, the watchdog automatically
tears down the connection at the BlueZ level before invoking the
callback.  This ensures the next ``establish_connection()`` call
starts fresh instead of adopting stale state.

class ConnectionWatchdog:
    """Monitor a BLE connection for notification activity.

    Tracks the time since the last :meth:`notify_activity` call.
    When the timeout is exceeded the optional *on_timeout* callback
    is invoked so the caller can trigger reconnection or cleanup.

    When *client* and *device* are both provided, the watchdog
    performs BlueZ-level cleanup before invoking the callback:

    1. ``client.disconnect()`` with a 5 s timeout (prevents hang
       on phantom connections).
    2. ``remove_device()`` via D-Bus to clear BlueZ cache.
    3. The *on_timeout* callback, where the caller can reconnect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeout:
        Seconds of inactivity before the watchdog fires.  Required —
        there is no default because only the caller knows the device's
        expected notification cadence.
    on_timeout:
        Async callback invoked when the timeout expires.
    client:
        The connected ``BleakClient``.
    device:
        The ``BLEDevice`` for the connection.
