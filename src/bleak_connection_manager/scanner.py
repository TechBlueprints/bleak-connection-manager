"""Managed BLE scanning with adapter rotation, locking, and InProgress retry.

This is the scan counterpart to :mod:`bleak_connection_manager.connection`.
It wraps ``BleakScanner`` with:

- **Per-adapter scan lock** — cross-process ``fcntl.flock`` so only one
  process scans a given adapter at a time (Stuck State 4 fix).
- **Adapter rotation** — if the scan lock on the current adapter can't be
  acquired quickly, or if BlueZ returns ``InProgress``, automatically
  rotate to the next adapter.
- **Hard timeout** — wraps every ``BleakScanner`` call in
  ``asyncio.wait_for()`` to guard against Stuck State 16 (scanner hangs
  ignoring its own timeout parameter).
- **Retry with backoff** — transient scan failures get retried across
  adapters before giving up.

Each workaround is independently removable.  When upstream or BlueZ
fixes the root cause, the corresponding code path can be deleted.

    adapters:

    scan_lock_config:
