"""BlueZ D-Bus utilities for connection state inspection.

Provides functions to detect phantom/inactive BLE connections and
construct BlueZ D-Bus object paths.  Uses the shared ``MessageBus``
from :mod:`.dbus_bus` and raw ``bus.call()`` for all queries — no
proxy objects, no introspection, no fire-and-forget ``AddMatch``.

These functions fill a gap: ``bleak-retry-connector`` does not expose
connection state inspection, and ``bleak`` itself does not provide
phantom detection.
