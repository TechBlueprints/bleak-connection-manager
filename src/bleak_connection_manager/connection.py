"""Outer retry loop wrapping bleak-retry-connector.

This is the core of ``bleak-connection-manager``.  It calls
``bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection(max_attempts=1)`` inside
its own retry loop, adding all the BlueZ workarounds between attempts:

- Per-device in-process lock (pre-attempt)
- Cross-process slot-based adapter locking (per-attempt)
- Phantom/inactive connection cleanup (pre-attempt)
- Adapter rotation (per-attempt)
- InProgress classification (post-failure)
- Stuck-state diagnosis + targeted fix (post-failure)
- Escalation chain (post-failure)
- Clear stale BlueZ state (post-failure)
- Post-connect validation (post-success)
- Thread-level safety timer (per-attempt)

Each workaround is independently removable.  When upstream or BlueZ
fixes the root cause, the corresponding code path can be deleted.

    Drop-in replacement for ``bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection()``

    Parameters
    ----------
    client_class:
        The BleakClient class (or subclass) to use.
    device:
        The BLE device to connect to.
    name:
        Device name for logging.
    max_attempts:
        Maximum number of outer retry attempts.
    adapters:
        List of adapters to rotate through.  If ``None``, auto-discovered.
        Pass a single-element list to pin to one adapter.
    close_inactive_connections:
        If ``True``, detect and clear phantom connections before each
        attempt.
    safety_timer:
        If ``True``, start a thread-level timer that cancels the
        connection attempt if the asyncio event loop appears blocked.
    try_direct_first:
        If ``True``, the first attempt uses ``use_services_cache=True``
        to try a direct connection from the BlueZ cache without scanning.
        This is 2-5 s faster than scan + connect (10-15 s) for devices
        that are already in the BlueZ cache.  Subsequent attempts revert
        to the normal scan + connect flow.  Useful for connect-on-demand
        services where latency matters.
    validate_connection:
        Optional async callback ``(client) -> bool`` called after a
        successful connection.  If it returns ``False`` (or raises),
        the connection is torn down and the next attempt starts.
    lock_config:
        Cross-process lock configuration.  If ``None`` or
        ``enabled=False``, no locking is performed.
    escalation_policy:
        Failure escalation policy.  If ``None``, a default policy
        with ``reset_adapter=False`` is used.
    overall_timeout:
        Hard ceiling (in seconds) for the entire connection process
        including all retry attempts and escalation.  If ``None``
        (the default), there is no overall timeout — only per-attempt
        timeouts apply.  Recommended values: 240 s for critical BMS
        connections, 300 s for sensors/switches.  When the timeout
        fires, an ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` is raised.
    **kwargs:
        Additional keyword arguments passed through to
        ``bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection()``.

    Returns
    -------
    BleakClient
        A connected BleakClient instance.

    Raises
    ------
    BleakAbortedError
        If all attempts are exhausted.
    BleakNotFoundError
        If the device cannot be found on any attempt.
