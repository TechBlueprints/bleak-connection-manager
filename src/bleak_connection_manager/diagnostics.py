"""Stuck-state diagnosis and targeted recovery for BLE connections.

Provides :func:`diagnose_stuck_state` to determine why a BLE connection
is stuck, and :func:`clear_stuck_state` to apply the minimal targeted
fix for each diagnosis.

Diagnosis uses two layers:

1. **D-Bus** (via ``bluez`` module) — BlueZ's cached view of the world.
2. **HCI** (via ``hci`` module) — the kernel's ground-truth connection
   list, queried through ``hcitool``.

Cross-referencing these two layers is the only reliable way to detect
phantom connections and stale handles.  If ``hcitool`` is not available,
HCI-dependent diagnostics (phantom detection, orphan handle detection)
are skipped and the module trusts D-Bus alone.
