"""Adapter claims under /run/bt-claims: informal cross-service coordination.

Several BLE services on one host share a set of Bluetooth adapters. This
module implements a file convention any service can follow without linking a
library or coordinating a rollout - a shell script participates with touch,
ls and noclobber. Everything below the line is the whole contract.

The convention (0.5)
--------------------

Directory: /run/bt-claims (tmpfs: a reboot clears every claim - claims are
statements by live processes, and both die with the boot).

Claims are keyed by the ADAPTER'S OWN MAC, colons stripped and uppercased
(0.4). hciN numbering is not stable - a USB reset renumbers a card, and so
does replugging it, both without a reboot - so a claim keyed by number can
come to name a different radio than the one its writer meant. The MAC is
the card. Every API here still accepts hciN as a convenience spelling and
resolves it (sysfs, then hciconfig) at use time, as does a MAC written any
way a human might type it: colons, dashes, dots, spaces, or none, any case.
An adapter whose MAC cannot be read at all - a dead controller reporting
all-zeros - degrades to its hciN name, because coordination must never fail
closed just because a card will not identify itself.

Convention 0.3 and earlier keyed files by hciN. Readers here canonicalize
every filename they find, so a 0.4 process counts a 0.3 process's claims
correctly, and exclusive claims (scan, link slots, drain) check the legacy
name before taking one - a mixed-version fleet cannot double-book a slot.
A 0.3 process cannot see 0.4 names, which is the usual version-skew
degradation: coordination quality, never correctness of the link itself.

Three claim kinds, visible in the filename (shown with an example MAC key
AABBCCDDEEFF; hciN in the 0.3 spelling):

    AABBCCDDEEFF.scan           hard claim: one well-known name per adapter.
                                "I am actively scanning here; use another
                                card." A HARDLINK to the holder's own file
                                (0.5, below), so two racing claimants cannot
                                both win and neither can be silently
                                displaced.
    AABBCCDDEEFF.scan.holder.<service>-<pid>-<seq>
                                the holder file the lock above links to.
                                Same inode as the lock; that shared inode IS
                                the proof of ownership.
    AABBCCDDEEFF.scanwait.<service>-<pid>-<seq>
                                queue ticket (0.5): "I want this card's scan
                                claim and I am waiting for it." Claims
                                nothing, gates nothing, blocks no reset -
                                it only publishes a queue so waiters spread
                                themselves over the cards instead of
                                stampeding one. Heartbeated and TTL-reaped
                                like any file here.
    AABBCCDDEEFF.use.<owner>[.<qual>]
                                soft claim: one file per claimant, optionally
                                qualified (this package qualifies by device
                                MAC, one file per connection). "I am using
                                this card, but I can share if you cannot
                                find another." Never blocks, only ranks.
    AABBCCDDEEFF.link.<k>       link slot: numbered exclusive claim,
                                k < the deployment-configured per-adapter
                                capacity. "One of this card's usable
                                connections is mine." Caps are opt-in
                                deployment config - dongle limits are
                                undocumented and not discoverable - and
                                bound established-link capacity, not
                                connection-attempt pacing.
    AABBCCDDEEFF.drain          drain claim (0.3): one well-known name per
                                adapter, hardlinked like the scan claim.
                                "This card is about to be reset; place new
                                work elsewhere and, if you can, move your
                                links off it." Held by the process
                                performing the recovery, heartbeated like
                                any claim, and released when the reset - or
                                the abandoned attempt - is over, so a dead
                                resetter's drain is reaped like anything
                                else. Draining is ABSOLUTE from 0.5: nothing
                                NEW starts on a draining card, with no
                                pinned or explicit carve-out. New work waits
                                (scans queue on a scanwait ticket; connects
                                raise the typed out-of-slots error and the
                                retry layer above paces the retry). A drain
                                window is bounded by the resetter's own
                                deadline, and the reset it precedes can only
                                ever fire on a card that emptied
                                VOLUNTARILY: existing work always beats
                                maintenance, and a single live claim of any
                                kind, foreign or our own, refuses the reset
                                at the deadline.

File content is one line: "<pid> <service> <since-epoch> [purpose]". This
implementation writes the manager's sanitized owner string as <service>, so
an ls-level debugger can see who holds a card; a bare participant may write
its process name instead. The writer touches its file every
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL seconds; the mtime is the heartbeat.

Exclusive locks are hardlinks (0.5)
-----------------------------------

The two exclusive well-known names - .scan and .drain - are held as a
HARDLINK rather than an O_EXCL file, because O_EXCL alone cannot express
"this claim is still mine". Two defects it left open, both reachable in a
fleet where every process reaps every other process's stale files:

- stale takeover was check-unlink-create, and the check and the unlink are
  separate syscalls. A taker acting on a liveness read taken microseconds
  ago could unlink a FRESH claim another process had created in between,
  and the victim never found out.
- the heartbeat's touch() called utime on the well-known NAME without ever
  asking whether that name still referred to its file, so two processes
  could both believe they held one card indefinitely.

The layout closes both:

- Acquire: write MAC.scan.holder.<service>-<pid>-<seq> first, then
  os.link(holder, "MAC.scan"). EEXIST on the link means the race was lost -
  never a partially-created claim.
- Ownership: os.stat(lock).st_ino == os.stat(holder).st_ino. Nothing else
  is proof. Checked on every heartbeat and before every release.
- Heartbeat: touch the HOLDER (the shared inode freshens the lock's mtime
  with it), then verify the inodes still match. A mismatch means the claim
  was provably taken; the holder says so at WARNING, marks itself lost and
  stops - it does NOT steal the name back, because two processes taking
  turns stealing a card is worse than one losing it.
- Stale takeover: os.rename(lock, lock + ".reaping.<pid>-<seq>"), never
  unlink. Rename is atomic and picks exactly one winner; the loser gets
  ENOENT and backs off. The winner re-checks that the file it moved aside
  is the same inode it diagnosed stale, and if it is not - a fresh claimant
  won the name in between - it links the file back under its own name and
  concedes, so the TOCTOU above cannot destroy a live claim.
- Release: verify the inode, unlink the lock (ENOENT is a correct outcome:
  a taker moved it aside first), then unlink the holder.

<seq> is a per-process monotonic counter, and it - not mtime - is the age
authority for the scanwait queue. Venus boxes have no RTC and step their
clock at the first NTP sync, sometimes by years, which would silently
reorder an mtime-ordered queue under its readers.

A 0.4 process reading a 0.5 directory is unaffected: it partitions a
filename at the first dot and matches the remainder exactly ("scan",
"drain") or by prefix ("use.", "link."), and "scan.holder.x",
"scan.reaping.x" and "scanwait.x" match none of those. It sees the .scan
lock, correctly, as a hard claim. Conversely a 0.5 process treats a plain
un-hardlinked MAC.scan - link count 1, no holder sibling - as a valid hard
claim judged the 0.4 way, on content pid and mtime. Both directions work
during the minutes a fleet spends mid-deploy.

A claim is live when the pid in it is alive (kill -0, or /proc/<pid> from
shell) AND the file's mtime is within CLAIM_TTL. A dead process is therefore
detected instantly, and a wedged-but-alive one within the TTL. Anyone may
unlink a file that fails both checks; unlink races are harmless, and a live
writer whose file is wrongly reaped recreates it on its next heartbeat
(exclusive claims - scan and link - recreate with O_EXCL and concede if
another process took the name meanwhile, so cards never ping-pong).

Placement, for a service choosing among its allowed adapters: drop adapters
with a live hard claim held by someone else, drop adapters with a live drain
claim, sort the rest by live soft-claim plus link count then by your own
preference order, take the first, write your claim. If every allowed adapter
is hard-claimed, a CONNECT uses the preferred one anyway and logs - a
scanner's claim must never keep a battery off the air - while a SCAN queues
(see scanwait) rather than starting unclaimed.

That asymmetry is the 0.5 correction, and it was paid for. Before it, a hard
claim was advisory for scans too: "every card is claimed, scan the best one
anyway". On 2026-08-26 that turned a busy fleet into an outage. A scan
started on a card another process in the SAME process tree was already
scanning, BlueZ answered StartDiscovery with InProgress, the wrapper scored
that as a radio failure, three such strikes power-cycled a perfectly healthy
adapter, and every USB reset mass-disappeared the devices on it - which is
the detonation path of the BlueZ gatt-client use-after-free. The coordination
that was skipped as "only an optimization" was the thing keeping the
evidence honest. A hard claim is a GATE for scanning: nothing scans without
holding it. Coordination remains an optimization for CONNECTS, where it
ranks rather than refuses, and an unusable claim directory still degrades to
uncoordinated everywhere.

Soft claims are shareable by design, so two services placing at the same
moment may briefly co-locate; distinct preference orders make that rare, and
it is legal when it happens.

A claim is a statement about a link, not the link itself, and the two can
drift: the claim can outlive the link (release it - that is what validity
checks are for) or the link can outlive the claim (re-acquire it - the link
exists regardless of what the files say). When judging whether the thing a
claim accounts for still exists, trust what was observed on the link - a
notification arriving, a GATT operation returning - over any cached
connection property; caches of link state go stale precisely in the failure
modes this convention exists to survive (field-validated twice, 2026-08).

Known limit, worth stating plainly: this convention only ever sees
processes that participate in it. A service that drives a radio some other
way - raw HCI sockets, a C program talking to BlueZ directly, an operator
at bluetoothctl - holds no claims and appears in no occupancy score, so
every score on such a host is structurally blind to that use. This is not
a gap a future adoption closes; it is the boundary of a file-convention
approach. (Concretely, on the deployment this was built for, one service
scans over raw HCI and is permanently invisible here.) Coordination is an
optimization over what it can see, never a guarantee about the radio.

This file is deliberately standalone - stdlib only, no asyncio, no bleak,
no imports from anywhere else in this package - so a service that wants
adapter coordination WITHOUT the bleak catcher can copy this one file into
its own tree and import it directly. The docstring above is the whole
specification; a participant that would rather not import anything can
follow it with ls, touch and cat. If you copy this file, record the commit
you took it from, so a convention bump can be traced.
